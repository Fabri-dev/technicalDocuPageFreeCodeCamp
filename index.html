                    C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C to create lists of instructions
                    for
                    a computer to follow. C is one of thousands of programming languages currently in use. C has been
                    around
                    for several decades and has won widespread acceptance because it gives programmers maximum control
                    and
                    efficiency. C is an easy language to learn. It is a bit more cryptic in its style than some other
                    languages, but you get beyond that fairly quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C is what is called a compiled language. This means that once you write your C program, you must run
                    it
                    through a C compiler to turn your program into an executable that the computer can run (execute).
                    And
                    here is an example of how to write Hello World in C:
                </p>
                <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
                    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
                    int main() 
                    { 
                        printf("Hello World!"); 
                        return 0; 
                    }

                <p>An Array is a sequential collection of elements, of the same data type. They are stored sequentially
                    in
                    memory.
                    Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate
                    variables
                    for each value.
                    To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array
                    followed by square brackets [].
                    To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of arrays:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Single dimensional array
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <code>int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                    </code>

                <p>
                    Array in C is static in nature, so its size should be known at compile time and we can not change
                    the
                    size of the array after its declaration. Due to this, we may encounter situations where our array
                    does
                    not have enough space left for required elements or we allotted more than the required memory
                    leading to
                    memory wastage. To solve this problem, dynamic arrays come into the picture. <br>
                    A Dynamic Array is allocated memory at runtime and its size can be changed later in the program.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We can create a dynamic array in C by using the following methods(there are more methods but these
                    are
                    the most used):
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using malloc() Function:
                </p>
                <code> //Syntax 
                    ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size);  
    
                    //Example 
                    ptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
                </code>
                <p>
                    Using calloc() Function:
                </p>
                <code>//Syntax 
                    ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size); 
    
                    //Example 
                    ptr = (int*) calloc(5, sizeof(float));
                </code>
                <p>
                    Resizing Array Using realloc() Function:
                </p>
                <code>//Syntax 
                    ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize); 
    
                    //Example 
                    ptr = realloc(ptr, size * sizeof(int));

            <header>Stack</header>
            <article>
                <p>A stack is a linear data structure. It follows the last in first out approach(LIFO). A new item is
                    added at
                    the top of a stack. Both insert and deletion operation is performed from one end of the stack. <br>

                    There are two functions associated with stacks. Push function to add elements to the stack and pop
                    function to remove elements from the stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consider the Example:
                    <br>
                    Imagine you have a cookie jar, and in this jar, you can add one cookie at the time. The process
                    where you enter one cookie at a time inside the jar is called push. Similarly, you can remove one
                    cookie at a time. This process of cookie removal from the topmost position is called a pop function.
                    <br>
                    The last entered cookie is the first to be removed from the jar, hence a stack follows a last in
                    first out approach.

                <p>
                    A Queue is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements. The queue operates on first
                    in first out (FIFO) algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider an example:
                    <br>
                    You are visiting a doctor for a check-up. There are many people at the clinic. A lady is entering
                    the names of all the people in a file. The person who comes first gets places first. When the doctor
                    is free, he calls the first patient inside. This is a queue and follows a first in first out method
                    as the first person to enter his name in the list gets treated first.
                    <br>
                    The people who are treated their names are removed from the list. This is how a queue works.
                    <br>
                    There are 2 pointers, the front is at the front of the queue and rear is at the back of the queue.
                    We add elements from the back of the queue and remove them from the front of the queue.

                    A Linked List is a data structure. It is linear. The Linked List is like an array but, the Linked
                    List is not stored sequentially in the memory. Every linked list has 2 parts, the data section and
                    the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.
                    <br>
                    The size of the linked list is not fixed, and data items can be added at any locations in the list.
                    The disadvantage is that to get to a node, we must traverse to from the first node to the node that
                    we require.
                    <br>
                    There are three types of link lists:

                    A tree is a data structure that has one root node and many sub-nodes. It is another one of the data
                    structures which are designed on top of a linked list.

                <p>
                    Hash table is another data structure. It is used to implement an associative array, a structure that
                    can map keys to values. Hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of
                    buckets. Hash tables are very useful data structures.
